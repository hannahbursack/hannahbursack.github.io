          <h2>Hello!</h2>
            <p>My name is Hannah and welcome to my online portfolio!</p>
            <p>I was born and raised in St. Louis, MO but I've always had big
            city dreams, so come graduation I left the Midwest for the thriving,
            global city of Miami. I'm now a senior at the University of Miami                  majoring in Public Relations with minors in Marketing and Entrepreneurship.</p>
            <p>I'm incredibly detail-oriented, aim to complete all tasks to the fullest
            of my abilities and greet difficult challenges with enthusiasm. I'm largely
            driven by my intense ambition and interested in pursuing a career in design,
            public relations and marketing.</p>
            <p>Feel free to check out my resume, graphic design pieces, and writing samples
            by navigating the tabs above. I hope this site allows you to further explore my
            work and personality. Enjoy!</p>
